# Recursive KalmanNet (RKN)

## About

We introduce **Recursive KalmanNet (RKN)**, a Kalman filter-informed recurrent neural network, designed to estimate both the state variables and the error covariance of a stochastic dynamical system from noisy measurements, **without requiring prior knowledge of the noise covariances**. This estimator preserves the structure of the Kalman filter while learning the gain and estimation error covariance through deep learning. It propagates the error covariance using the **recursive Josephâ€™s formula** and optimizes the **negative Gaussian log-likelihood**.

## Python Version and Dependencies

This project was developed and tested using **Python 3.12.8**.  

Using the exact same version is not strictly necessary. You can check your Python version with:


> python --version

To create a compatible environment and install all required dependencies:

> python3.12 -m venv venv  
> source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Folder Architecture

- `.data/`: Stores all datasets used in the project.
- `.models/`: Contains saved trained models.
- `.results/`: Automatically saves training and validation loss curves, and may also include plots.
    - `.results/loss_curves/`: Saves loss curve values during training and validation.
    - `.results/plot_saves/`: Folder that can be specified to save generated plots.
- `Algo/`: Includes class definitions for dynamical systems, the Kalman filter, the Recursive KalmanNet, and loss functions.
- `Tools/`: Provides utility functions for data generation and plotting.

## Entry point

The `main_bimodal_noise.ipynb` notebook offers a practical illustration of how to use this codebase.  
The dynamical system is a one-dimensional constant-speed linear kinematic state-space model, with a position measurement. The measurement noise follows a gaussian bimodal distribution. The notebook covers:
- data generation according to the defined dynamical system
- demonstrates the use of the Kalman Filter
- demonstrates the instantiation, training, and usage of the Recursive Kalman Filter.

The notebook also includes several plots featured in the first paper listed above.
